    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>This website has been designed to educate you about Ethereum smart contract vulnerabilities.</p>
    <p>Check out the resources section to learn about the various known vulnerabilities, examples of real attacks and security tools that can be used to prevent vulnerabilities.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>There are 8 smart contract challenges that need to be 'hacked'. Each one highlights a different security vulnerability.</p></li>
        <li><p>To play the challenges you must have <a href="/metamask">MetaMask</a> installed. MetaMask is a browser extension that allows for easy interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. <a href="https://metamask.io/"> MetaMask can be downloaded here</a></p></li>
        <li><p class="w3-text-red">**Please use a testnet to complete the challenges**</p></li>
        <li><p>Test networks are different to the mainnet. They are used by developers to experiment with their smart contracts before deploying them to the main network. Testnet Ether is separate from mainnet Ether and has no real monetary value.</p></li>
        <li><p>To make transactions on the network you will need <a href="/metamask"> Testnet Ether</a>, which is a cryptocurrency that acts as a fuel for the network. Every time a transaction is made, a small amount of Ether is burned. <a href="/metamask">Testnet Ether is obtained primarily by using a faucet.</a></p></li>
        <li><p>Once you have attempted some of the challenges, please complete the <a href="/survey">questionnaire</a> about the experience.</p></li>
    </ul>
